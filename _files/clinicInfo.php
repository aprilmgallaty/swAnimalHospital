	<h2>Appointments</h2>

		<p>We do our very best to get you the appointment you want, however, there's a few things you should be aware of &hellip;</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If you want to get your animal in for a check-up, please call 3 to 5 days in advance of the specific date you want.</li>
			<li>Since this practice focuses on exotic pets, appointments go fast and  several days in advance.</li>
			<li>Saturday fills up especially fast.</li>
			<li>We work very hard to accommodate emergencies and keep scheduled appointments on time.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="important">If you have an emergency during regular business hours, please call us at 503-643-2137.  After business hours, call  The Emergency Veterinarian Clinic of Tualatin at 503-691-7922 or Dove Lewis at 503-228-7281 or The Tanasbourne Emergency Clinic at 503-629-5800. </p>

	<h2>Consultations</h2>

		<p>We provide consultation services for veterinarians both locally and out of state. If you live far from us and have a difficult medical problem with your exotic pet, you may have your veterinarian contact us at our email address or business phone number.</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>We can review records and lab tests from your vet and provide expert advice.</li>
			<li>There is a $35.00 fee per case <span class="important"> not per call, so no repeat fees are charged with multiple calls on a case.</span></li>
			<li>We bill the veterinarian who requests the consultation, and typically the vet passes the cost along to the pet owner.</li>
		</ul>

<section id="pricing">

	<h2>Pricing</h2>

		<ul>

			<li>Please call us at 503-643-2137 if you have any general questions about pricing.</li>
			<li>The exact cost of your visit cannot be determined on the phone.</li>
			<li>Please request an estimate at your visit. We cannot give an accurate estimate until the Dr. sees your pet &amp; determines what is wrong &amp; what can be done.</li>
		</ul>
